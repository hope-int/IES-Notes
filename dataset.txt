Comprehensive Academic Audit: Undergraduate Engineering Curricula at IES College of Engineering (KTU Affiliated)
1. Institutional Governance and Academic Framework
The academic architecture of IES College of Engineering, situated in Chittilappilly, Thrissur, operates under the rigorous regulatory purview of APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU). As a premier technical institution in Kerala, the college aligns its pedagogical strategies with the university's evolving statutes, specifically the transition between the 2019 Regulation (applicable to senior cohorts) and the 2024 Regulation (applicable to junior cohorts). This report provides an exhaustive, granular analysis of the curriculum, syllabus content, and course hierarchies across all offered Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) programs. The data synthesized herein encompasses semester-wise subject listings, course codes, credit distributions, and module-level syllabus details where available, providing a definitive reference for academic stakeholders.   

1.1 Program Portfolio and Specializations
The institution offers a diverse array of engineering disciplines, ranging from foundational branches to cutting-edge computational specializations. The B.Tech programs are structured into eight semesters over four academic years.

Table 1: B.Tech Degree Programs at IES College of Engineering

Department Code	Program Name	Specialization Track	Scheme Applicability
CE	Civil Engineering	Construction & Infrastructure	2019 & 2024
ME	Mechanical Engineering	Design & Manufacturing	2019 & 2024
EEE	Electrical & Electronics Engineering	Power Systems & Control	2019 & 2024
ECE	Electronics & Communication Engineering	Signal Processing & VLSI	2019 & 2024

The distinction between the "Robotics and Automation" (2019 Scheme) and "Robotics and Artificial Intelligence" (2024 Scheme) represents a strategic realignment of the curriculum to emphasize software intelligence alongside hardware mechanics.   

2. The 2024 Scheme: Group-Based Foundation (Semesters 1 & 2)
The 2024 Regulation introduces a paradigm shift from a unified first-year curriculum to a "Group-Based" system. This approach segregates engineering branches into four clusters—Group A (Information Science), Group B (Electrical Science), Group C (Physical Science), and Group D (Life Science)—allowing for domain-specific foundational training immediately upon entry.   

2.1 Group A: Computer and Information Science
This curriculum governs the Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) and Computer Science (Data Science) branches. It prioritizes computational logic and discrete mathematics over classical mechanics.
